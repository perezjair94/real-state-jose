## FEATURE

We want to create a Real Estate Management System for educational purposes

The goal is to build a minimalist property management application using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that demonstrates professional web development skills while providing students with a portfolio-ready project.

Core System Modules:

- Properties management with photos and details
- Client database with contact information
- Real estate agent profiles and assignments
- Sales transaction tracking and reporting
- Contract management with document handling
- Rental property management and payments
- Visit scheduling and coordination

We need:

- To be able to manage properties (add, edit, view, filter by type/price/location)
- To be able to handle client information with document types and preferences
- To be able to track sales, contracts, rentals, and property visits
- To be able to generate automatic IDs (CLI001, INM001, AGE001, etc.)
- To be able to simulate CRUD operations for all entities

## EXAMPLES & DOCUMENTATION

All specifications and requirements are detailed in:
- Database schema: `db-schema.jpeg` (7 entities with relationships)
- Educational approach: `propuesta-mejoramiento.md` (interface design and user guidance)
- Current implementation: `index.html` (existing real estate management structure)
- Complete specification: `PRPs/real-state-landing-page.md` (comprehensive technical details)

Additional research may be needed for:
- Professional interface patterns for business applications
- Form validation techniques using vanilla JavaScript
- Responsive design best practices for educational projects

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

- Educational Focus: Code must be clear, well-documented, and easy for students to understand
- Single File Approach: Keep everything in one HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript
- No External Dependencies: Use only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - no frameworks or libraries
- Professional Appearance: Design should look like a real business application suitable for portfolios
- Database Simulation: Use JavaScript arrays and objects to simulate database operations
- Entity Relationships: Maintain proper links between Cliente, Inmueble, Agente, Venta, Contrato, Arriendo, and Visita
- Responsive Design: Must work properly on both mobile and desktop devices
- It's very important that the application demonstrates real-world business patterns while remaining educationally accessible
